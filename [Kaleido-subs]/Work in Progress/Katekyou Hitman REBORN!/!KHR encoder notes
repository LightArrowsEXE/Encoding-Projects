Some notes for certain encoding decisions taken while working on this show, since I've heard some critiscms about various things and 
would like to explain my reasoning behind some of the filter choices.

## Upscaling:

Generally, there's very little reason to scale an anime beyond its native resolution. At best you'd usually see people upscale from 
native back to 1080p, but that's obviously not the case here, so why? The answer is fairly simple and unfortunately pretty boring. As 
I'm sure most are aware, your average video players' scalers are pretty lackluster and do a pretty poor job of upscaling videos without 
additional artifacting. Part of the reason for upscaling this is to give video players an easier time and make the end picture still 
look a lot better than if you were to play a 480p video back in 1080p. Luckily, while the US BD has its issues, overall the picture 
quality is good enough to allow for this.


Additionally, there's also various filtering applied that "add detail" (cough), like for example grain. This would also look better 
on a 720p -> 1080p upscale than on a 480p -> 1080p upscale.


## Waifu2x on Nnedi3's frames and "leftover combing"

One of the biggest issues with the US BDs lies in that it's 480p. The masters were more than likely native 480i, evidenced in the JP BDs 
still remaining interlaced and, ofcourse, a whole lot of leftover combing. Originally I was planning on just simply nnedi3ing them and 
hoping for the best, but after talking about it a bit with various people and trying out different things, I'd noticed that running 
Waifu2x on them *generally* did a fairly good job at making it look slightly better in most situations. Examples are included below. 
While overall still far from perfect, it beats having to find completely new ways to handle every single fade that has this issue and 
the slight detail loss  in some scenes is far less noticeable than the combing.

## Why not just use the JP BDs?

... Yes, I've actually had someone unironically ask me this. Reason is simple: the upscale for the JP BDs is absolutely hideous. They also 
decided to up the contrast to eleven for whatever reason, and that resulted in dark areas getting completely wiped of any and all detail. 
They're only good for the audio, which beats the US BD pretty easily with their shit AC-3 encodes.


## Random Comparisons I made while working on this instead of just keeping it all in one place:

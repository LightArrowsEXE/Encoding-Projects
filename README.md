Various of my scripts for encoding anime.
Most have public releases
under various Fansub group names,
so you can find them
if you look hard enough.

You are free to
make use of these scripts as reference
for your own scripts.
Credit is appreciated,
but not required.
I also accept pull requests,
so if there's something you feel could be improved
don't hesitate to send one in!

### You can find subtitle files for some groups here:

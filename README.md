# Encoding Projects

[![lint](https://github.com/LightArrowsEXE/Encoding-Projects/actions/workflows/lint.yml/badge.svg)][linter_gh]

This is a collection of my scripts for encoding anime.
Most have public releases under various fansub group names.

All the projects can be found [here][projects_all].
These cover most, if not all of the scripts uploaded here,
and can be used to track my progress on them.
Every item will also have an [issue][issues] assigned to them.

You are free to make use of these scripts as reference for your own scripts.
Credit is appreciated, but not required.

*You can find subtitle files for some groups here:*

- [Kaleido-subs][kaleido]
- [Good Job! Media subs][gjm]
- [DameDesuYo subs][ddy]

## Directories, naming, and what they mean

Tags are added to clarify what the scripts are intended for.
These may not be 100% followed, but should be for the most part.

| Tag | Description | Source |
|-----|-------------|--------|
| None | Scripts for a WEB/TV/etc. Release | WEB, TV, Unknown |
| BD   | Scripts for a Blu-ray Release | BDMV |
| DVD  | Scripts for a DVD Release | DVDISO |
| Various | Scripts using more than two varying kinds of sources | Varies |

If a directory is untagged, please apply common sense when looking over the scripts.

| Directory | Description | Updates? |
|-----------|-------------| ---------|
| Completed | Scripts are finalised, encode might not necessarily be done | Might receive updates with significant filter changes |
| Currently Airing | Scripts updated on a rough week-to-week basis | Continual updates, streamlined once completed |
| Dropped | Scripts are no longer being updated, project is dropped | None |
| Other | Scripts for minor projects, standalone OP/EDs, etc. | Might receive updates with significant filter changes |
| Work in Progress | Scripts for projects that are currently being worked on | Continual updates |

## Old scripts

My repo has gone through some clean-up lately.
This is both due to personal coding style changes,
and more emphasis being put on linting and automation,
as well as a change in common modules run.
For an archived version, please check out the [old_scripts branch][old_branch].

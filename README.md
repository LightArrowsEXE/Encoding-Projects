# Encoding Projects

Various of my scripts for encoding anime.
Most have public releases
under various Fansub group names,
so you can find them
if you look hard enough.

You are free to
make use of these scripts as reference
for your own scripts.
Credit is appreciated,
but not required.
I also accept pull requests,
so if there's something you feel could be improved
don't hesitate to send one in!

**You can find subtitle files for some groups here:**

- [Good Job! Media subs][gjm]

## Directories, naming, and what they mean

Tags are added to clarify
what the scripts are intended for.

| BD   | Scripts for a Blu-ray Release | BDMV |
| DVD  | Scripts for a DVD Release | DVDISO |

If a directory is untagged,
please apply common sense
when looking over the scripts.

## Old scripts

My repo has gone through some clean-up lately.
This is due to personal coding style changes
and more emphasis being placed on linting and automation,
as well as a change in common modules run.
For an archived version, please check out the [old_scripts branch][old_branch]

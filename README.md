Various of my scripts for encoding anime. Most (will) have public releases under various Fansubgroup names, so you can find them if you look hard enough.

You are free to make use of these scripts as reference for your own scripts. Credit is appreciated, but not required. I also accept pull requests, so if there's something you feel could be improved send one in!

### You can find subtitle files for some groups here:

# [◯PMan] Scripts

The scripts for my ◯PMan releases.
These are far more experimental than my regular scripts,
and usually act more as a playground for me to try out new things and setups,
as well as test out my new functions.
Don't use those scripts for actual projects without properly vetting them
to make sure they work for the entire show.

These files are split a bit differently from my regular scripts.
Here, I first split them into content type (Seasonal, Visual Novel, Game, etc.),
and then further split those into years/seasons.
Every directory is also tagged with a code for a common database for that content type
(for example, anime is tagged with `a#####`, VNs with `v#####`.
`a8292` would be [Ben-To's ID][bento_anidb],
whereas `v5000` would be [Root Double's ID][root_vndb]).
For a full list of databases used,
refer to the table at the bottom of this README.
If you still have trouble finding entries,
they are usually linked in the year/season's README.
If you have any good suggestions for databases to use over the current ones,
please let me know in an Issue/Discord PM.
It is most definitely not final for every content type yet.

You may sometimes still see movies/OVA OP/EDs included in the seasonals directory,
but that's mainly because I don't think forcibly splitting everything apart is *that* beneficial for those entries.

Included with every seasonal directory is also a WIP list of all the OPs and EDs that came out in that season to my knowledge.
Please let me know in an [Issue][issues_link] if I forgot something in those lists!

(Also obligatory *I AM **NOT** ΣDMan*,
stop asking me about their stuff)

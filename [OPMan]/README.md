## [◯PMan]

The scripts for my ◯PMan releases.
These are far more experimental than my regular scripts,
and usually act more as a playground for me to try out new things and setups,
as well as test out my new functions.
Don't use those scripts for actual projects without properly vetting them
to make sure they work for the entire show.

These are also ordered a bit differently from my other directories.
Here,
I first split shows up into seasonals and other
(movies,
OVAs,
specials,
etc.).
I then dump the scripts in the relevant folders (the season they aired in for multicour stuff).
Additionally I also add an `[a#####]` code,
which is the show's AniDB ID.
For example, an ID of `a8292` would be [Ben-To's ID][bento_anidb].
This makes everything a lot easier to oversee for me.

You may sometimes still see movies/OVA OP/EDs included in the seasonals directory,
but that's mainly because I don't think forcibly splitting everything apart is *that* beneficial for those entries.

Included with every seasonal directory is also a WIP list of all the OPs and EDs that came out in that season to my knowledge.
Please let me know in an [Issue][issues_link] if I forgot something in those lists!

Note:
I'm doing a mixed 720p/AAC,
1080p/FLAC release
upon request.
Thus, the two scripts
will be fairly different.
If you use them,
make sure you use
the correct scripts
to suit your needs.
If you want to
encode it in 720p,
use the 720p script.
For 1080p,
use the 1080p scripts.
Since some dependencies are private,
you might have to substitute them.
No support will be given for that,
but I suggest using BM3D
at various different strengths.
Higher for brighter areas,
lower for darker areas.

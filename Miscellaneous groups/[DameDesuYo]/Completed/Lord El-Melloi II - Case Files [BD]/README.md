**NOTE:**
I'm doing a mixed 720p/AAC,
1080p/FLAC release
upon request.
Thus, the two scripts
will be fairly different.
If you use them,
make sure you use
the correct script
to suit your needs.

Since some dependencies are private,
you might have to substitute them.
No support will be given for that,
but finding decent replacements
shouldn't be hard.

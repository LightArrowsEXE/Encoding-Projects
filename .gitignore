# Ignored project directories.
# These usually were uploaded at some point, but hidden either because of various reasons,
# ranging from them being basically empty, discontinued, horribly breaking some things, etc.
# If you want to see the files in actions, check the commit history of this file.

# Ignoring a temp archival directory. Git annoyingly keeps bugging me about them, so I'm ignoring scripts/projects I haven't touched in a long time here.
